# Project Roadmap: Aether Fracture
**From Concept to Prototype**

---

## PHASE 1: THE FOUNDATION (Defining the Variables)
*Before designing individual cards, you must lock down the math and the physical constraints.*

### 1.1 Finalize the "Global Math"
- [ ] **Define Resource Caps:** Confirm the maximums for Iron (e.g., 20), Aether (10), and Command (7).
- [ ] **Define Unit Stat Baselines:**
    - [ ] Tier 1 (Cost: 2 Iron, Str: 2, HP: 1)
    - [ ] Tier 2 (Cost: 5 Iron + 1 Aether, Str: 5, HP: 2)
    - [ ] Tier 3 (Cost: 10 Iron + 3 Aether, Str: 9, HP: 4)
- [ ] **Define the Deck Size:**
    - [ ] Starting Deck: 10 Cards.
    - [ ] Max Deck Size (Soft Cap): ~20 Cards (to keep the game tight).

### 1.2 The Map Architecture
- [ ] **Hex Count:** Determine how many hexes are needed for 2, 3, 4, and 5 players to ensure the map isn't too empty or too crowded.
- [ ] **Tile List:** Finalize the exact number of each terrain type (e.g., 6 Forests, 6 Mountains, 4 Ruins, 4 Water, 1 Shard).
- [ ] **Side B Effects:** Create the "Fractured" version for every single terrain type.

---

## PHASE 2: FACTION DESIGN (The Asymmetry)
*This is the bulk of the creative work. Do this one faction at a time to ensure they feel unique.*

### 2.1 The "Big 7" Data Sheets
For each faction (Synod, Horde, Walkers, Silence, Ironbound, Astral, Obsidian), create a spreadsheet containing:
- [ ] **The "Rule Break":** Explicitly write down the one core rule they ignore.
- [ ] **Starting Deck (10 Cards):**
    - [ ] 3x Economic Cards (Iron heavy)
    - [ ] 3x Movement Cards
    - [ ] 2x Attack Cards
    - [ ] 2x Faction Special Cards
- [ ] **The Heroes:** Write the exact text for Hero A and Hero B abilities.
- [ ] **Tech Tree Nodes:** Define the 3 unique tech upgrades for Zone C of their player board.

### 2.2 The "Dual-Use" Card Library (The Market)
Design the shared pool of cards players can buy.
- [ ] Create a list of 40–50 unique Market Cards.
- [ ] **Balance Check:** Ensure there is an even spread of Top-Heavy (Combat) and Bottom-Heavy (Economic) cards.
- [ ] **Cost Curve:** Ensure there are cheap cards (cost 2-3), mid-range (4-6), and heavy hitters (7+).

---

## PHASE 3: PROTOTYPING (The "Ugly" Version)
*Do not use the final art yet. Use text and simple icons.*

### 3.1 Digital Component Creation
- [ ] **Card Template:** Create a simple layout in Canva, Photoshop, or Nandeck with the "Split" design (Top/Bottom).
- [ ] **Map Tiles:** Print simple Hexes on cardstock. Label them "Forest", "Mountain", etc.
- [ ] **Player Boards:** Print the layout on standard A4 paper. Use pennies or generic cubes for tracking resources.

### 3.2 Physical Assembly
- [ ] Sleeve the printed cards with backing (use Magic: The Gathering cards as stiffeners).
- [ ] Gather generic tokens for Units (Meeple colors work fine for now).
- [ ] Gather cubes for resources.

---

## PHASE 4: INTERNAL PLAYTESTING (The Mechanics Check)
*Play alone or with one trusted partner. Do not invite a full group yet.*

### 4.1 The "Engine" Test (Solo)
- [ ] Pick a faction. Play 4 rounds (Epoch I) without an opponent.
- [ ] **Check:** Do you generate enough resources to buy things? Does the "Dual-Use" decision feel agonizing or obvious?
- [ ] **Adjust:** If you have too much money, increase card costs. If you have too little, increase Starting Deck output.

### 4.2 The Combat Test (1v1)
- [ ] Set up two armies on adjacent hexes.
- [ ] Run the combat sequence 10 times using different cards.
- [ ] **Check:** Does the "Deterministic" math work? Is the "Bluffing" element fun? Does the "Combat Edge" make sense?

---

## PHASE 5: EXPANSION & BALANCE (The Full Group)
*Now you make it playable for 5 people.*

### 5.1 The "Void" Mechanic Tuning
- [ ] Test the Epoch III map shrinking mechanism.
- [ ] **Check:** Does it happen too fast? Does it unfairly kill players, or does it feel like a fair ticking clock?

### 5.2 Faction Balancing
- [ ] Play a game with **Horde vs. Synod** (Aggro vs. Defense). Does the Defense hold up?
- [ ] Play a game with **Astral vs. Ironbound** (Magic vs. Tech). Is the movement advantage of Astral too strong?

---

## PHASE 6: POLISH & ART (The Visuals)
*Once the game works, make it beautiful.*

### 6.1 Art Asset List
- [ ] **Card Art:** 50+ unique illustrations (You have the style guide now).
- [ ] **Board Icons:** Create clear icons for Iron, Aether, Command, Sword, Shield.
- [ ] **Hero Art:** 14 Portraits (2 per faction).

### 6.2 Rulebook Writing
- [ ] Draft the full rulebook (incorporating the Core Rules and Combat Guide I provided).
- [ ] Create a "Quick Reference" sheet for the back of the rulebook.

---

## PHASE 7: EXTERNAL BLIND PLAYTESTING
*Give the box to a group of friends, sit back, and DO NOT TALK.*

- [ ] Watch them try to learn the game from the rulebook alone.
- [ ] Note where they get confused.
- [ ] Note which Faction wins most often (is one OP?).

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP:
**Start Phase 2.1.**
Pick **ONE** faction (e.g., The Ironbound Union) and fully write out their 10 starting cards and 3 Tech Upgrades. This will set the standard for the other 6.
